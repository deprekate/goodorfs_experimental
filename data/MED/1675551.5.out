Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 476
Remaining ORFs number: 135
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 115
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 90 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 31
TUL genes number: 39
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model....
Re-train TUL TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
