Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using a Fisher discriminant function...
Remaining: 538
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 242 genes.
Second run of TIS model.

Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda > 0: TUL TIS model is similar to TUI TIS model.
Re-train TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
