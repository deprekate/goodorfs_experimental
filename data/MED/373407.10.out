Selected root coding ORFs number: 43
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 201
Remaining ORFs number: 169
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 105
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 64 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 29
TUL genes number: 17
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
