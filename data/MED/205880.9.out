Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 407
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 121 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 51
TUL genes number: 24
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model....Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
