Selected root coding ORFs number: 68
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 202
Remaining ORFs number: 244
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 195
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 86 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 27
TUL genes number: 31
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model.Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
.
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda > 0: TUL TIS model is similar to TUI TIS model.
Re-train TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
