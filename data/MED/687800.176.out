Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using a Fisher discriminant function...
Remaining: 468
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 224 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 94

Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda > 0: TUL TIS model is similar to TUI TIS model.
Re-train TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
