Selected root coding ORFs number: 40
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 234
Remaining ORFs number: 169
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 116
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 63 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 24
TUL genes number: 21
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model.Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
.
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model.Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
.....
Re-train TUL TIS model...
Choose final TIS...
