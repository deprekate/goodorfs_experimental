Selected root coding ORFs number: 211
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 836
Remaining ORFs number: 615
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 465
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 300 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 83
TUL genes number: 94
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda > 0: TUL TIS model is similar to TUI TIS model.
Re-train TIS model.......
Choose final TIS...
