Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 147
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 100 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 29
TUL genes number: 23
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model...
Re-train TUL TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
