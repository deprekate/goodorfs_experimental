Selected root coding ORFs number: 69
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 473
Remaining ORFs number: 241
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 172
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 106 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 34
TUL genes number: 36
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
.Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
