Selected root coding ORFs number: 66
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 499
Remaining ORFs number: 215
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 144
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 102 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 33
TUL genes number: 36
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model.....Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Re-train TUL TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
