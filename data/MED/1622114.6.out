Remaining: 125
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 85 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 40
TUL genes number: 16
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model.Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
