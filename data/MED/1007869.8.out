Selected root coding ORFs number: 184
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 832
Remaining ORFs number: 233
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 244
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 216 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 95
TUL genes number: 60
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Lamda > 0: TUL TIS model is similar to TUI TIS model.
Re-train TIS model..
Choose final TIS...
