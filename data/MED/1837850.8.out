Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using a Fisher discriminant function...
Remaining: 226
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 96 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 37
TUL genes number: 27
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
