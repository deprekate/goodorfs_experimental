Selected root coding ORFs number: 19
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 105
Remaining ORFs number: 62
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 42
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 28 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 13
TUL genes number: 1
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts
