Selected root coding ORFs number: 117
Rejected non-coding ORFs number: 201
Remaining ORFs number: 384
Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 372
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 131 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 39
TUL genes number: 31
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model...Extrem low percentage for certain TIS.
Will omit the start codon column in the weight
matrix of starts

Re-train TUL TIS model......
Choose final TIS...
