Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using a Fisher discriminant function...
Remaining: 472
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 227 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)
TUI genes number: 93
TUL genes number: 36
Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model....
Re-train TUL TIS model.....
Choose final TIS...
