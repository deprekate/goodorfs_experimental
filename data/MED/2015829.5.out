Select coding ORFs from remianing ORFs using Fisher discriminant functions...
Remaining: 155
Process overlapping genes...
Totally predict 82 genes.
Second run of TIS model.
Extract TUI and TUL genes (length >300bp)

Compare TUI TIS model with TUL TIS model...
Train TUI TIS model..
Train TUL TIS model..
Lamda < 0: TUL TIS model differs from TUI TIS model
Re-train TUI TIS model.....
Re-train TUL TIS model...
Choose final TIS...
